### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis

### Description
This project utilizes Python to analyze bike share data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal is to explore the data and answer various questions by calculating descriptive statistics. Users will interact with a terminal-based script that allows them to input parameters and receive insights about bike share usage in these cities.

### Features
- **Data Exploration**: Load and explore bike share datasets from Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate and display statistics such as trip duration, most popular start and end stations, and user demographics.
- **Interactive User Experience**: A terminal-based interface for users to input their preferences and get customized statistics.
- **City-Specific Analysis**: Ability to analyze data for each city individually or compare statistics across cities.
- **Error Handling**: Manage user input errors to ensure a smooth experience.
